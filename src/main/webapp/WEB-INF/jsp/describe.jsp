            <h1>Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning</h1>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are transformative technologies that are reshaping industries and everyday life. AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. Machine Learning, a subset of AI, involves training algorithms to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content">
            <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence encompasses a broad range of technologies and approaches aimed at creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions. AI systems can be categorized into two main types: narrow AI and general AI. Narrow AI is designed for specific tasks, such as voice assistants and recommendation systems, while general AI aims to perform any intellectual task that a human can do, though this remains largely theoretical.</p>
            <p>AI techniques include rule-based systems, expert systems, and more advanced methods like neural networks and deep learning. Rule-based systems operate based on predefined rules, while expert systems use knowledge bases to make decisions. Neural networks, inspired by the human brain, and deep learning, which involves multiple layers of neural networks, are used for more complex tasks such as image and speech recognition.</p>

            <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
            <p>Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms that enable computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms can be classified into three main types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.</p>
            <p>In supervised learning, algorithms are trained on labeled data, where the input-output pairs are known. The model learns to map inputs to outputs and can make predictions on new, unseen data. Common applications include classification tasks, such as spam detection in emails, and regression tasks, such as predicting house prices.</p>
            <p>Unsupervised learning involves training algorithms on unlabeled data to identify patterns or groupings within the data. This type of learning is often used for clustering, such as segmenting customers based on purchasing behavior, and dimensionality reduction, such as reducing the number of features in a dataset while preserving important information.</p>
